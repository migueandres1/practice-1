# Excersise 7

Write a script that takes two numbers as input and generate a list of random numbers between the two input numbers, each number must exist once. The first number will be considered the minum value of the list and the second number the maximum value.

Your script should output the missing numbers sorted by value. Example:

```
first number: 1
second number: 15
generated list: [8, 10, 11, 7, 3, 15, 6, 1, 14, 5, 12]
missing_numbers: [2, 4, 9, 13]
```

  ---> 
The number 1 should be in the input array, if it's not present in the input array, should be included in the results. See the example below.
